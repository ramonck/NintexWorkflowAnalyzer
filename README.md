# NintexWorkflowAnalyzer
Since the Nintex Workflow Analyzer stopped working in Codeplex, I have recompiled the project and also copied over to github.

You can use the binary directly in the release.

The NuGet packages that are pre-requisites for this project are:
Xceed.Products.Wpf.DataGrid.Full
jacobslusser.ScintillaNET
